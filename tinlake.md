Function Code:
```solidity
function submitLoan(
    uint256 loanId, 
    uint256 amount, 
    address borrower, 
    bytes memory proof
) public {
    bytes32 loanHash = abi.encodePacked(loanId, borrower);
    require(verifyProof(proof, loanHash), "Invalid proof");

    // Process the loan submission
    loans[loanId] = Loan({
        amount: amount,
        borrower: borrower,
        state: LoanState.Submitted
    });
    emit LoanSubmitted(loanId, amount, borrower);
}
```

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:
`abi.encodePacked`

Explanation

Purpose:
The `submitLoan` function is used to submit a new loan application to the Tinlake protocol. This function is critical for the protocol as it handles the initial step in the loan lifecycle, ensuring that loan submissions are properly verified and recorded.

Detailed Usage:
In this function, `abi.encodePacked` is used to create a hash (`loanHash`) of the loan ID and the borrower's address. This hash serves as a unique identifier for the loan submission, ensuring that each loan can be distinctly identified and associated with the correct borrower.

The encoding method `abi.encodePacked` is chosen here because it efficiently concatenates the loan ID and the borrower's address into a single byte array, which is then hashed to produce a compact, unique identifier. This identifier is essential for verifying the proof provided by the borrower, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the loan submission process.

The `verifyProof` function checks the validity of the proof against the generated loan hash. If the proof is valid, the loan details are stored in the `loans` mapping, transitioning the loan state to "Submitted," and the `LoanSubmitted` event is emitted.

Impact:
The `submitLoan` function is pivotal for the Tinlake protocol as it ensures the secure and verifiable submission of loan applications. By using `abi.encodePacked`, the function creates a compact and unique loan identifier, which is essential for verifying the authenticity of loan submissions. This contributes to the overall security and integrity of the protocol, preventing fraudulent submissions and ensuring that each loan is accurately tracked and processed.
